## Elevator Pitch

<!-- FooDood is a mobile application that combines the concept of Tinder with selecting something to eat. Users will be able to swipe left or right on food options and the app will match them with other users who have similar food preferences. Users will be able to chat with each other and make plans to meet up and eat together. -->

- We are Brenden, Stephen, Rudy, and Konrad, senior computer science students at CSU Long Beach.
- Have you ever been hungry and didn't know what to eat?
- FooDood is a mobile application that combines the concept of Tinder-swiping with selecting something to eat.
- Science says that it is easier to make a decision when presented with simple options such as "yes" or "no" rather than a large list of options.
- FooDood will present users with a list of food options in their area and they will be able to swipe left or right on the options to decide what to eat.
- With this product, we will be able to help people make decisions on what to eat more easily and efficiently.
