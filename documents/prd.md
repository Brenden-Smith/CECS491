## Elevator Pitch

<!-- FooDood is a mobile application that combines the concept of Tinder with selecting something to eat. Users will be able to swipe left or right on food options and the app will match them with other users who have similar food preferences. Users will be able to chat with each other and make plans to meet up and eat together. -->

FooDood is a mobile application that combines the concept of Tinder-swiping with selecting something to eat. Science says that it is easier to make a decision when presented with simple options such as "yes" or "no" rather than a large list of options. FooDood will present users with a list of food options and they will be able to swipe left or right on the options. The app will make a list of the plates that the user has swiped right on in a session, and present it to them at the end of the session. The app will then allow the user to select a plate, and present them with the restauruant information, and available delivery services to order that plate.

## User Description

**Goal**: To find a place to eat that is close to the user and has food that they like to eat.  
**Motivation**: The user is hungry and wants to eat something that they like to eat.  
**Frustration**: The user is hungry and does not know what they want to eat.
