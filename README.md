FooDood is a mobile application that combines the concept of Tinder-swiping with selecting something to eat. Science says that it is easier to make a decision when presented with simple options such as "yes" or "no" rather than a large list of options. FooDood will present users with a list of food options in their area and they will be able to swipe left or right on the options to decide what to eat. With this product, we will be able to help people make decisions on what to eat more easily and efficiently. We are different from food delivery apps' recommendations because we present options to users with only two choices - “yes” or “no” - rather than a large list. We also present options by plate rather than by restaurant.
